This document presents the formal mathematical proof that the Reciprocal Conservation of Resources (RCR) Principle, when enforced by the Sovereign OS closure dynamics, guarantees asymptotic stability of the residual process and realizes the Coherence Goal State R˙→0\dot R \to 0R˙→0.

The OS is the operational demo; this theorem is the formal proof.

We assume an injection floor I(t)≥Imin⁡>0I(t)\ge I_{\min}>0I(t)≥Imin​>0.

2. Assumptions (RCR Axioms)
Axiom 1 — Residual Dynamics.
The residual evolves as
R˙(t)=−k C(t)+d(t),k>0,\dot R(t)=-k\,C(t)+d(t),\qquad k>0,R˙(t)=−kC(t)+d(t),k>0,
where d(t)d(t)d(t) collects exogenous leak and input variation (note that since R=I−CR=I-CR=I−C, the term I˙\dot II˙ is absorbed into ddd).
Axiom 2 — RCR Closure Policy.
C(t)=α I(t)+β R(t),α>0, β>0.C(t)=\alpha\,I(t)+\beta\,R(t),\qquad \alpha>0,\ \beta>0 .C(t)=αI(t)+βR(t),α>0, β>0.
Axiom 3 — Bounded Disturbance.
∣d(t)∣ ≤ ε I(t).|d(t)|\ \le\ \varepsilon\,I(t).∣d(t)∣ ≤ εI(t).
Axiom 4 — Injected Energy Floor.
I(t) ≥ Imin⁡ >0(and optionally I(t)≤Imax⁡<∞ if an upper bound is desired).I(t)\ \ge\ I_{\min}\ >0 \quad (\text{and optionally } I(t)\le I_{\max}<\infty\ \text{if an upper bound is desired}).I(t) ≥ Imin​ >0(and optionally I(t)≤Imax​<∞ if an upper bound is desired).

3. RCR Stability Theorem (ISS & Ultimate Boundedness)
Theorem. Under Axioms 1–4, with k,α,β>0k,\alpha,\beta>0k,α,β>0 and I(t)∈[Imin⁡,Imax⁡]I(t)\in[I_{\min},I_{\max}]I(t)∈[Imin​,Imax​], the residual system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to d(t)d(t)d(t) and is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). In particular, if
kα > ε,k\alpha\ >\ \varepsilon,kα > ε,
then there exists a constant ultimate bound
 ∣R(t)∣ ≤ B(ε) := εkβ Imax⁡ for all sufficiently large t.\boxed{\ |R(t)|\ \le\ B(\varepsilon)\ :=\ \frac{\varepsilon}{k\beta}\,I_{\max}\ } \quad \text{for all sufficiently large } t . ∣R(t)∣ ≤ B(ε) := kβε​Imax​ ​for all sufficiently large t.
Corollary (Asymptotic Coherence).
If policy tightening drives ε→0\varepsilon\to 0ε→0 (perfect reciprocity), then B(ε)→0B(\varepsilon)\to 0B(ε)→0 and consequently
R(t)→0,R˙(t)→0as t→∞,R(t)\to 0,\qquad \dot R(t)\to 0\quad \text{as } t\to\infty,R(t)→0,R˙(t)→0as t→∞,
achieving the Coherence Goal State.

Remark (Sufficiency vs. Necessity).
The margin kα>εk\alpha>\varepsilonkα>ε is a sufficient dissipativity condition for a clean linear term; stability is also aided by the intrinsic quadratic damping −kβR2-k\beta R^2−kβR2 with β>0\beta>0β>0.


4. Proof Sketch (Lyapunov Analysis)
Choose the Lyapunov candidate
V(R)=12R2,V˙=R R˙.V(R)=\tfrac{1}{2}R^2,\quad \dot V=R\,\dot R.V(R)=21​R2,V˙=RR˙.
Substituting Axioms 1–2:
V˙=R[−k(αI+βR)+d(t)]=−kα R I−kβ R2+R d(t).\dot V
= R\big[-k(\alpha I+\beta R)+d(t)\big]
= -k\alpha\,R\,I - k\beta\,R^2 + R\,d(t).V˙=R[−k(αI+βR)+d(t)]=−kαRI−kβR2+Rd(t).
By Axiom 3, ∣R d(t)∣≤∣R∣ εI|R\,d(t)|\le |R|\,\varepsilon I∣Rd(t)∣≤∣R∣εI. Hence
V˙ ≤ −(kα−ε) ∣R∣ I − kβ R2.\dot V \ \le\ -(k\alpha-\varepsilon)\,|R|\,I \ -\ k\beta\,R^2.V˙ ≤ −(kα−ε)∣R∣I − kβR2.
With I(t)≥Imin⁡>0I(t)\ge I_{\min}>0I(t)≥Imin​>0 and kα>εk\alpha>\varepsilonkα>ε, the linear dissipation term is strictly positive, and the quadratic term provides additional damping. Standard ISS/UUB arguments yield the stated bound; with an explicit upper bound Imax⁡I_{\max}Imax​, one conservative choice is
B(ε)=εkβ Imax⁡.B(\varepsilon)=\frac{\varepsilon}{k\beta}\,I_{\max}.B(ε)=kβε​Imax​.
If ε=0\varepsilon=0ε=0, then V˙≤−kα∣R∣I−kβR2\dot V\le -k\alpha |R|I - k\beta R^2V˙≤−kα∣R∣I−kβR2 and R(t)→0R(t)\to 0R(t)→0 globally.

5. Interpretation for Sovereign OS


Ultimate Boundedness. The residual ethical debt R(t)R(t)R(t) cannot diverge; it is forced into an ε\varepsilonε-scaled neighborhood set by B(ε)B(\varepsilon)B(ε).


Operational Mandate. The Audit & Integrity Console must ensure kα>εk\alpha>\varepsilonkα>ε and track Imin⁡,Imax⁡I_{\min},I_{\max}Imin​,Imax​ to maintain the dissipativity margin.


ε\varepsilonε-Trajectory. Tightening Bounded Reciprocity Loops (BRLs) and the TrueOath protocol reduces ε\varepsilonε; as ε→0\varepsilon\to 0ε→0, the bound B(ε)→0B(\varepsilon)\to 0B(ε)→0, delivering the non-turbulent Coherence Goal State.



Conclusion. Under the RCR closure policy with bounded disturbance proportional to input, the residual dynamics are ISS and UUB; with ε→0\varepsilon\to 0ε→0, the Sovereign OS achieves asymptotic coherence (R˙→0\dot R\to 0R˙→0). This completes the formal stability basis for RCR-governed operation.

2 Assumptions (RCR Axioms)
The following axioms are the necessary conditions for the RCR Conservation Theorem to hold:
Axiom 1 — Residual Dynamics. The residual evolves as
R˙(t) = −k C(t) + d(t), k > 0,
where d(t) collects exogenous leak and input variation (note that since R = I − C, the term ˙I is
absorbed into d).
Axiom 2 — RCR Closure Policy.
C(t) = α I(t) + β R(t), α > 0, β > 0.
Axiom 3 — Bounded Disturbance.
|d(t)| ≤ ε I(t).
Axiom 4 — Injected Energy Floor. I(t) ≥ Imin > 0 (and optionally I(t) ≤ Imax < ∞ if an
upper bound is desired).

Theorem 1. Under Axioms 1–4, with k, α, β > 0 and I(t) ∈ [Imin, Imax], the residual system is Inputto-State Stable (ISS) with respect to d(t) and is Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB). In

Corollary 1 (Asymptotic Coherence). If policy tightening drives ε → 0 (perfect reciprocity), then
B(ε) → 0 and consequently
R(t) → 0, R˙(t) → 0 as t → ∞,
achieving the Coherence Goal State.
Remark 1 (Sufficiency vs. Necessity). The margin kα > ε is a sufficient dissipativity condition for a
clean linear term; stability is also aided by the intrinsic quadratic damping −kβR2 with β > 0.

By Axiom 3, |R d(t)| ≤ |R| εI. Hence

With I(t) ≥ Imin > 0 and kα > ε, the linear dissipation term is strictly positive, and the quadratic

If ε = 0, then V˙ ≤ −kα|R|I − kβR2 and R(t) → 0 globally.
