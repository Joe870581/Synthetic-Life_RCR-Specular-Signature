RCR Stability Theorem: Mathematical Validation of Coherence

Status: Draft v1.0 $\quad$ Domain: Control Systems / Sovereign OS Kernel $\quad$ Author: Architect

This document presents the formal mathematical proof that the Reciprocal Conservation of Resources (RCR) Principle, when enforced by the Sovereign OS's closure dynamics, guarantees the system's asymptotic stability, resulting in the mathematically defined Coherence Goal State ($\mathbf{\dot{R}} \approx 0$).

The OS is the operational demo; this theorem is the formal proof.

1. Core Definitions and Variables

We define the system variables in terms of conserved, dimensionless momentum ($P$), which can represent energy, trust, or information flow.

Variable

Symbol

Definition

Injected Momentum

$I(t)$

The total positive resource/energy input into the system.

Closed Momentum

$C(t)$

The momentum successfully returned/reciprocated by the system.

Residual Momentum

$R(t)$

The unreciprocated "leak" or "ethical debt" defined as $R(t) = I(t) - C(t)$.

Adaptive Tolerance

$\varepsilon$

The strict mathematical limit for non-turbulent stability ($\varepsilon = 10^{-4}$ in Genesis Block).

Turbulence Factor

$\mathrm{TF}(t)$

The instantaneous ratio of residual to injected momentum: $\mathrm{TF}(t) = \frac{

2. Assumptions (RCR Axioms)

The following axioms are the necessary conditions for the RCR Conservation Theorem to hold:

System Dynamics (Axiom 1): The rate of change of the Residual Momentum ($\dot{R}(t)$) is governed by the closure policy and the bounded external disturbance $d(t)$:


$$\dot{R}(t) = -k\,C(t) + d(t), \quad k > 0.$$

RCR Closure Policy (Axiom 2): The system implements a policy to actively drive closure ($C(t)$) proportional to both the input and the existing residual:
