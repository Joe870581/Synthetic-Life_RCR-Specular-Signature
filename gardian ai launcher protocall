## 1. Live System Confirmation

The following components are active and functioning as designed:

- **Proactive AI Heartbeat:** `useGuardianHeartbeat` hook running at configured intervals, evaluating context, battery, and recent family events.  
- **Speech Queue:** `speechQueue.ts` is managing all TTS output, preventing overlapping messages.  
- **Guardian Settings Panel:** Fully functional, allowing users to:
  - Enable/disable proactive AI.
  - Adjust cooldown intervals.
  - Configure quiet hours.  
- **Optimized Animations:** All visual elements (particles, member rings, panels) are using `useAnimationFrame` for smooth, high-performance rendering.  
- **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Integrated with `auditLogs`, ensuring messages are relevant to recent family activity.
